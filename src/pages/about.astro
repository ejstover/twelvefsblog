	<p>
		I'm Eric Stover, and I write about networking, automation, and the systems I build along the
		way. ff.ff.ff.ff.ff.ff is my space for practical notes, lessons learned, and the occasional
		deep dive into infrastructure. The name is a nod to the ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff Ethernet broadcast
		address, so the ideas here are meant to be available to everyone.
