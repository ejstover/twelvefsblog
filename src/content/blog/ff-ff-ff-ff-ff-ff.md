I built this blog for the same reason I build most things in my lab: I wanted to try something new. It lives on GitHub and ships via GitHub Actions.

## Why “ff.ff.ff.ff.ff.ff”?

A broadcast address is a special type of networking address reserved for sending messages to all nodes on a network segment. If you're reading this, you're in my network segment.

## Git

Git has been a significant blind spot for me. I understand the idea of Git and can repeat some key terms, but in reality I need hands-on experience.

This blog is my sandbox for that. Every post is a change. Every change is a commit. Every commit is practice.

## AI: force multiplier, not a substitute

I’m also using this blog to work out where AI fits into my workflow.

Frankly, I'm tired of hearing the term "AI slop." Yes, there is plenty of AI slop being created. However, don't let that distract you from truly understanding the impact of LLMs.

Here’s the line I’m trying to walk:

* AI can help me draft, outline, and sanity-check this blog and my work.
* AI can help me approach and learn topics I might otherwise avoid.
* But the opinions, the tradeoffs, the stories, and the accountability are mine.

If something goes up here, it’s because I believe it and I've thought about it driving to work more than once.

## What you can expect here

Likely short-form articles that are hastily thought through. I'll be heading to Silicon Valley in April with the Network Field Day as a delegate for the 40th (I think) event.

If you want to challenge me, start with this: **Where do you personally draw the line between “AI-assisted” and “AI-authored”?**
